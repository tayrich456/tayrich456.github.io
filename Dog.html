	<h3>  Rosie is easily my best friend. Rosie is a combination of the breeds Cocker Spaniel 
	and Miniature Schnauzer. When she was 9 weeks old, she was shipped on an airplane
	to Portland, Maine where my sister and I picked her up last May. Being the puppy that she still is, 
	she's probably the most creature I've ever met. Her favorite activities include:
	getting into the garbage, shredding any piece of paper/newspaper/paper towel she can find, and lastly, running 
	away. Besides these minor flaws in her personality, she's probably the smartest dog I've ever met and is
	not easily fooled or tricked. (Trust me, I've tried) </h3>
