	<h3> Throughout my entire grade school career, I was fortunate enough to remain in the 
	same school system. The best part about that was being able to graduate with kids that
	I'd gone to school with since kindergarten. In high school there were a few accomplishments
	that I was able to achieve; I received at least honors all 4 years, I was invited to 
	be in the Gifted and Talented Art Program, I was involved with yearbook for a few years, 
	and accepted on the Varsity cheerleading team each year. All these accomplishments ultimately 
	led to my graduation in 2015.   </h3>
