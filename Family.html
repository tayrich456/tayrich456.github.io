	<h3> My immediate family consists of myself my mom, my dad, my brother, my sister, and my
	grandmother. My brother, Greyson, is actually my half brother; while my sister, Lauren,
	is my "full" sister. Contrary to the pictures below, people say that my sister, who is
	 3 years younger than me, could be considered my twin (I don't see it); seriously, people get 
	 us mixed up all the time. The little 
	 old lady in my family portrait is my grandma, or as we call her, Nannie. Don't let her age
	 fool you, she's one of the most wild people I've ever met. Overall, my family seems 
	 pretty conventional, but I'd consider them to be anything but that.  </h3>
