	<h3> Cheering is the one consistent things in my life. I started out doing gymnastics when I was
	9, and continued that for 5 years before finally giving it up for cheering. I technically started 
	cheering in middle school and continued all the way through high school; even 
	becoming a captain my senior year. I did all-star cheering for two years, starting my senior
	year, and even got to compete at the national competition in Dallas, Texas in February of
	2016. The year after I graduated from high school, my sister became a freshman, so I decided to 
	become an assistant coach at my alma mater so that I could continue to help the program and
	coach my sister, on top of being on the all-star team. 
	This year is my first year being on the University of Maine team, and we will 
	be traveling to nationals in Daytona, Florida this April. </h3>
